## About Me

I am a researcher working on Natural Language Processing (NLP). My work focuses on fact-checking, ambiguity and uncertainty. I have a background in Linguistics, and I try to bring the linguistic perspective into my NLP projects to give them grounding in theory of human language.

I am currently in the third year of my PhD and I am open to opportunities in academia, industry and governmental/NGO sectors. I value interdisciplinary approaches and societal impact of NLP work.
